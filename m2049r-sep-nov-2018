**WHO**

I am m2049r, creator of Monerujo - The Monero Android Wallet.

**WHAT**

I was funded March - August 2018 and would like to continue in that spirit. Please see previous posts for completed milestones & tasks.

Primarily I will be moving the Monerujo App along according to our feature list on Taiga as well as improving the usability as dictated by the Monerujo Team.

**HOW MUCH**

12 weeks x 10 hours/week = 120 hours. @ 0.58XMR per hour = 70XMR.

(June - August I spent 140 hours in addition to Ledger integration)

**NEXT STEPS**
