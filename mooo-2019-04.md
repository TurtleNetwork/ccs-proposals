Hi,

I'm continuing my work on Monero as always, and I'm asking for support for 3 more months.
I've started adding RPC tests to monerod and monero-wallet-rpc, and I'll be adding more of those in the near/medium future. They've already found a few bugs.

Some of the things I'm planning to work on:
- new output selection system for better privacy
- 0.14.1 release
- more pruning related work
I'll also probably work on multiuser transactions. Possibly on pay-for-service for RPC. If the MRL vets it early enough, Dandelion. And a lot of other things I'm sure.

Link to the last two months' work: https://forum.getmonero.org/6/ideas/91206/moneromooo-january-march-coding

Using the customary hourly $30 + .2 monero guide, with monero currently at ~$51, the target this time is 410 monero.

Thank you
