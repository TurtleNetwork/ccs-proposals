Greeting everybody again!

Thank you for supporting my previous [FFS](https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress/90573/moving-instructions-and-manuals-into-the-video-format-and-launching-news-feeds). Possibly something went wrong, not like I planned it, but during working process I sincerely tried to improve every video and translation, investing part of my soul in my work.


### Who?

I am [v1docq47](https://t.me/v1docq47), member of [XMR.RU](https://xmr.ru/) team

I participate and take active part in [Monero Localization](https://taiga.getmonero.org/profile/v1docq47) and [Monero Outreach](https://taiga.getmonero.org/profile/v1docq47) working groups.

Since September 2017 I translate into Russian everything related to Monero. Recently I started to make teaching and news videos about Monero for [Monero Russian Community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChZc5PLsbP5zeFrmOYMKGmA).

### What?

In my first FFS I was too optimistic and didn’t realized what amount of time I will be spending to create simple but high quality videos, which are easy to understand for ordinary user.

This time I have 5 month experience and I will be realistic about my work.

I am planning to continue to help experienced and ordinary users to know something new. I have a lot of new ideas, which are just needed to be transferred from paper to screen.

I don’t want to stuck in routine work with videomaking, I will do my best to improve this format and do something interesting and unusual.

In addition to videomaking I will continue my Monero localization work.

Please don’t be confused with low amount of subscribers and views on my channel. I could buy views/subscribers, but it won’t be my own victory. I want to reach thousand audience by my own.


### The Proposal and Milestones

I am planning to make 6-8 new videos per month for my channel for the next 6 months. These will be: news, manuals and other Monero information materials.

I still hope to add interviews to my channel as an extra format (despite I had some technical difficulties during first episode). Possibly it will be new format of short podcasts, but I need time to realize it.

In my spare time I will continue to localize Monero project for Russia.


### How much and Payouts

Any kind of work must be paid, especially work which is pleasured for you and your viewer/reader.

Payment on first days of every month during 6 months for my upcoming work.

3$ hour/ ~30 hours a week or ~130 hours a month. Usually I spend much more spare time for my work.

Average Monero course for a month is ~50$

#### In total:

46.8 XMR for 6 month work's

7.8 XMR month starting from February
