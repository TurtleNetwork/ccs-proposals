### Proposal ###
This proposal is to throw another Monero Party on Augutst 10th, 2019, Saturday night at Defcon 27 in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. 
I have an agreement with a club at a Defcon hotel where we will provide DJs for the night and anyone with a Defcon Badge or Monero Badge gets in free +1 guest.

### Importance to the Monero Community ###

Defcon is a hacker convention which promotes the principles of privacy and open source, which align with the Monero project. Exposing hackers to Monero is an excellent opportunity to gain real users and developers to the project. The party gives the opportunity for contributers to the project and the village an opportunity to interact with Defcon attendees outside the official bounds of the con.
In 2017 there was a small gathering funded by Defcon attendees in a small suite.
In 2018 there was an official Monero Village at Defcon and a larger suite party.

The funds would go toward:
1. Hiring DJ (DJs from the hacker community bring more hackers to the event) $1500 ($300/DJ)
2. Creating Monero medallions, (as we have done the past 2 years #BadgeLife) $800 ($8.00/Medallion)
3. Glowsticks, candy, party trinkets, signs, stickets, etc. $500
4. Drinks (anything money not spent will be used to buy drinks to be given to Monero Badge holders) $200
