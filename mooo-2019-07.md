Hi all,

I'm continuing with more work on Monero. This is my request for donations for this work for the next three months.

Highlights of last three month stint can be found here:
https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/merge_requests/46

Here are some of the things that I'm expecting to work on:

    0.14.1 release
    bandwidth savings in sync
    more tests
    CLSAG integration (assuming it passes final MRL vetting)
    Possibly Dandelion, assuming again MRL vets a monero version

With the usual hourly $30 + .2 monero guide, and monero currently at <s>~$93</s> <s>~$85</s> ~$82, the target this time is <s>272</s> <s>288</s> 294 monero.

Thank you
