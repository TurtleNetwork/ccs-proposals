A big thanks again to everyone who supported our initial FFS!(final report) We learned a lot during the first round, have created a solid foundation, and are ready to jump back in for a new round of Outreach related awesomeness. We hope the Monero community is as enthusiastic as us about whatâ€™s ahead! Below is a breakdown of what we intend to work on. Please note the Ongoing Project Tasks that we are working on now, during, and in between our FFS proposals. We have continued to volunteer on this important endeavour in between proposals.
WHO:

Monero Outreach. We are a team of creators, writers, technicians, translators, and visionaries. This is our Mandate:

    Drive greater Monero adoption and awareness through a variety of outreach-related activities - particularly public relations, education, and marketing.
    Respect the work done by the Core Developers and community workgroups, the founding principles of Monero, and to the Monero ethos at all turns in the road so we do not jeopardize the integrity of what makes Monero great.
    Make the world a better place through Monero. We are motivated by the question: "How can we expect to prepare our children to live in this world, if we haven't prepared the world for our children?"
