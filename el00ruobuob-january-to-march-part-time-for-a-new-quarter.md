### ELOORUOBUOB PART TIME FOR THREE MONTH

Hi there,

El00ruobuob again, asking if you want to support my work for the current quarter.

#### Report since last quarter

I have been missing a bunch of report lately, and i've not done as much as i expected (but still respecting my minimum devoted time), but here's what i did:

* [Finished the Wallet RPC refresh, based on 0.13 wallet-rpc](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site/merge_requests/898)
* [Translated the developer guides to French](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site/merge_requests/939) (pending merge)
* Did a few correction on both wallet & server rpc guides
* Updated a few user guide to 0.13
* Translated the Gui wallet guide to French
* Reported the community meetings
* Helped in translating the GUI for 0.14
* [Updated the French Quick Facts sheet from Outreach Workgroup](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs/pull/102)
* Maybe other things i can't remember

#### Current work list

1. Hangout Page

I started working a few month ago to a new hangout page.  
It had been discuss in community meeting a while ago, and an issue is opened since [here](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site/issues/775)  
I made a few tests and think about "what should be the best", and come with a solution:

* The hangout page should highlight a support section on the right (as it is actually for StackExchange), and adding the r/MoneroSupport along with the MRW website in this section.  
* The hangout page must let user choose where to join the discussion, based on the tools he use, or based on the things he wanted to do. So i replaced the left side panes with a dynamic section where you can choose "By Platform" (listing all channels/groups/sites on all platforms, including IRC, Mattermost, Reddit, Taiga, Telegram, external website & ressources), or "By WorkGroup" (listing all the workgroups with their respectives places.  
This is still an ongoing work, as i try to figure out how to best handle this at code (html/liquid/<lang>.yml) level, but you can see and test it on [my own branch](https://repo.getmonero.org/el00ruobuob/monero-site/tree/Hangout).


2. Research Lab & Dev Meetings reports

A few weeks ago, dEBRUYNE asked me if i may be able to add the Research Lab meetings & Dev meetings logs to the blog.  
I accept the task and started with the Research Lab Meeting backlog ([10 meetings' logs in a merge request atm.](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site/merge_requests/999))

3. GUI guide update to 0.14

With the upcoming upgrade, i proposed to help Erciccione with the updates on the GUI Guide.  
I haven't started yet but offers to work on this in the next days.

4. MMS guide translation

I started to tranlate this just before the GUI call for translator.  
It is a huge user-guide and will requires more time than i suspected.

5. Miscellaneous

Other small activities always needs time every now and then.  
There are new strings for Monerujo i haven't translate to French yet (or even look at).  
I continue to post the Community Meeting logs and do any stuff i can to help anyone asking for (as long as it doesn't requires me to lengthen a day's 24h)

#### *It's not about the money money money*

But, still...

For this new Quarter, in this obviously Bear market, i am asking for 1.25XMR per hour, on a 3 hours a week basis.  
That's a 15XMR a month, so 45XMR total.

My milestone will be monthly-based:

* January: **15XMR**  
* February: **15XMR**  
* March: **15XMR**  

Anyway, feels welcome to give your thoughts, or ask for emergency work from me.  

See you soon!
